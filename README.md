# Introduction To Robotics - 23WSB141

## Robot Modelling Coursework
#### Due Week 11, Semester 1 - W/C 11/12/23

### Notes and Comments:
- Many instances of where for loops should have been used
- Methods should be written more generically for further flexibility
- Should have utilised kwags* for params instead
- Qlims are hard coded in init class - Should be their own table
- should have made my own robust plotting method for more customisability than sympy plot
